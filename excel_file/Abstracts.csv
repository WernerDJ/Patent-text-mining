The present invention relates to a surgical simulator that may be used to train surgeons in a few tasks related to minimally invasive surgery.
 To be specific, the simulator can be used to train surgeons in the following tasks: eye-hand coordination, poking the computer model of a liver or a kidney on a computer screen while the deformation is observed on the screen.
 The simulator makes use of hyperelastic boundary-elements.
 Moreover, the simulator makes use of the hyperelastic boundary-element-codes developed by this inventor.
 The simulator consists of a computer screen, a keyboard, a mouse, and a multi-core CPU. The mouse pointer (on the computer screen) represents the tip of a surgical tool.
 The simulator would include the three-dimensional geometry (3D computer model) of representative human kidney and human liver.
 The simulator has provisions for detecting the collision between the 3D model of the liver or the kidney on the screen and the mouse pointer (tip of the surgical tool) on the screen.
 In addition, the simulator has provisions for interactively displaying the deformed shape of the liver or the kidney on the screen, depending on the position of the mouse pointer (tip of the surgical tool) on the screen.
 This patent application uses many sentences from the same inventor’s another invention titled “A surgical simulator for training surgeons in a few tasks related to minimally invasive surgery” (Indian patent application number: 201641031739, date of filing: September 17, 2016). However, the two inventions are based on two different technologies; the present invention is based on hyperelastic boundary-elements whereas the earlier invention is based on linear elastostatic boundary-elements.
 Moreover, the two inventions are two different and independent products.
 Neither of the inventions may be thought to be an improvement of the other.
 Of course, although they are two different products, they cater to the same customer group.
 Which of the two products is going to be more successful depends on whether the customer prefers the present invention or the previous invention; after selling sufficient number of products one can know which of the products is more successful.
 At least, extensive testing/validation is required before one can know which of the inventions is the better product."

A fiber scanning system can have optimized performance by substantially matching the natural frequencies of the fiber scanning system's actuator and fiber optic scanning element. By matching the natural frequencies, the fiber scanning system can increase the maximum distance that the tip of the fiber optic scanning element may be driven relative to a resting position. Such an effect may be produced because matching the natural frequencies of the fiber scanner allows for larger amplitudes to be achieved. It should be noted that the natural frequency of the scanning system can be selected to avoid excitation frequencies that could destabilize the system. In this way, the system as a whole may act as a tuned mass damper or a tuned resonance structure, thereby improving scan performance while maintaining a stable scanning system."

An interventional device, e.g. an intravascular catheter such as IVUS or OCT, by using an optical shape sensor (OSS)-based mechanism at the time of the intravascular image acquisition. An OSS fiber with a predetermined shape is merged with the intravascular catheter and the predetermined shape of OSS fiber has OSS identifiable features positioned to allow optical determination of orientation (rotational angle relative to a longitudinal axis of the catheter) at the longitudinal position of the catheter where the imaging sensor resides. The predetermined shape of the OSS-device indicates an angle of rotation of a predetermined reference orientation of the catheter relative to an OSS sensor during navigation/pullback of the intravascular catheter through a vessel. Alternatively, or additionally, a multi-core OSS cable can be used, which allows calculation of twist angle between two nodes of the OSS cable, and thus a measure of rotational angle. With such a system, it is possible to get rotational angle (orientation) information gathered for each intravascular image. Such orientation information can be used to visualize one single image with correct angular alignment. Further, by calibrating individual images of a pull-back sequence with respect to the gathered rotational angle and position information, it is possible to orient the cross- sectional intravascular data on an X-ray image with improved accuracy that may have better diagnostic value."

The following relates generally to ensuring patient safety while operating a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machine. Many MRI systems operate using: fiber optic cables to carry signals, electrically conductive cables to carry other signals,and radio frequency (RF) coils to create an electromagnetic field. Typically, the electrically conductive cables and RF coils do not interact in a way that causes harm to a patient. However, certain shapes and/or lengths of cables exhibit the phenomenon of ""resonance"" that increases their propensity to concentrate RF currents induced by the RF coils. This may increase the temperature of the cable or other component in the MRI system leading to patient harm. The methods disclosed herein provide a solution to this by sensing a shape of the fiber optic cable and determining if the fiber optic cable will exhibit resonance. If it is determined that resonance may potentially occur, an alarm may be generated or a radio frequency amplifier may be interlocked."

A distributed imaging system uses non-ionizing radiation in the form of microwaves to image the body. This non-ionizing radiation is safer for a patient than traditional x-rays. The majority of image processing takes place in a centralized computing environment which receives microwave image data from many remote data acquisition sites (such as imaging centers, radiology groups, and/or doctor's offices). The centralized computing environment is specially configured to receive microwave image data from many sites and produce microwave images based on the received microwave image data. The microwave images may then be sent back to the acquisition site and/or to other sites for viewing and evaluation.

Present invention concerns generally to a sensor or a sensor system for detecting spilling of aqueous liquids, for instance in confined spaces were such is critical such in an airplane. The system of present invention is an early warning system or sentinel for the prevention of corrosion by corrosive liquids. Corrosion caused by corrosive liquids can rapidly change the surface properties of components in engineering structures, and that will finally endanger the functionality of structural parts. However, if monitoring technologies are in place providing continuous information on the presence of corrosive liquids, corrosion treatment and even corrosion prevention can start at a very early stage. Present invention provides such by early detection of corrosive liquids by extended sensors based on the collapse of percolation conductivity (COPC). The term collapse refers to the fact that the transition into the non-conducting state must not necessarily have the properties of a thermodynamically well-defined transition."

Various techniques are disclosed for systems and methods to provide image resolution enhancement. For example, a method includes: receiving a reference image (e.g., a visible light image) of a scene comprising image pixels identified by pixel coordinates; receiving a lower-resolution target image (e.g., an infrared image) of the scene; resizing the target image to a larger size; determining an adaptive-shape neighborhood for each pixel coordinate, wherein the adaptive-shape neighborhood extends from the each pixel coordinate such that those reference image pixels that are within the shape-adaptive neighborhood meet a regularity condition; determining, for each adaptive-shape neighborhood, a local estimate based on those target image pixels that are within the adaptive-shape neighborhood; and aggregating the local estimates associated with the adaptive-shape neighborhoods to provide a global estimate that corresponds to the target image with an improved resolution. A system configured to perform such a method is also disclosed."
