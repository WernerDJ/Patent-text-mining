# Patent-text-mining
Text mining tools for patent literature

Developed in R.

The dataset was obtained from patentscope as an excel file. An example of the dataset is saved in the folder excel_file

The WIPO search page allows to download up to 100 rows of patent data with abstracts and up 
to 10 000 without them. Since 100 is often an unrepresentative number to text mine any technical field the abstracts have
to be obtained from another web page. About 5 or 10% of the abstracts are not obtained but if the sample is large enough that 
shouldn't pose a problem
